We are talking about a person who gave an important contribute to computing in education.
</p>

<p>
Papert MIT made a project with Lego, he wants to teach children kids to be creative thinkers, in honour of Seymour Papert
<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/lego-foundation-endows-media-lab-fellowships-to-honor-the-legacy-of-seymour-papert/">https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/lego-foundation-endows-media-lab-fellowships-to-honor-the-legacy-of-seymour-papert/</a>
</p>

<p>
They made the lego mindstorm
</p>

<p>
There are two approaches relating to computing in education: Constructivism, proposed by Piaget and Constructionism, developed by Papert.
</p>

<p>
As described in (??, ????), Constructivism revolves around the idea of experience and active interaction as necessary tools for learning.
</p>

<p>
Papert, who worked with Piaget around 1960, built upon that idea and came up with a theory that shared the importance of learning through experience and added that this process happens through the creation and sharing of a public entity. (??, a)
</p>

<p>
An important part of the philosophy of Constructionism is the concept of <b>microworlds</b>, described as “…subset[s] of reality or a constructed reality so … as to allow a human learner to exercise particular powerful ideas or intellectual skills” (Papert 1980, p. 204).
</p>

<p>
Papert also believed that the right tool to implement microworlds is a computer, because "its essence is its universality, its power to simulate.". It can help to create an atmosphere that supports active involvement and promotes learning.
</p>

<p>
As a consequence, he developed Logo - a functional programming language based on Lisp - with the intent of introducing children to programming from a young age.
</p>

<p>
A key feature of the Logo programming language is <b>turtle graphics</b>, consisting of a cursor over a Cartesian plane. The cursor has a location, a direction and a pen. The direction of the cursor can be changed by the student with commands relative to its current position, by specifying an angle of rotation. This intuitive approach leads to what Papert called "body syntonic" reasoning (TODO explain what it is)
</p>

<p>
Over time, an active community developed around Logo and several implementations have been created. The <a href="https://constructionism2025.inf.ethz.ch/">Constructionism Conference</a> happens every 2 years and its the main one (TODO correct here)
</p>

<p>
Bebras is a competition for kids. (TODO what to do with this info)
</p>

<p>
Since Papert's definition of Constructionism, computing as a field has become even more important. Nowadays computers are important a key tool for design, engineering and science. Computer science has long become a discipline of its own, tightly coupled with Mathematics. Many countries are putting initiatives in place to spread the knowledge about the discipline.
</p>

<p>
Question for next time: what should kid be able to understand and know about computer science?
