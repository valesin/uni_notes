<ul>
<li><a href="#org3dd72ac">The concept behind my activity stems from an didactic workshop for secundary low grade schools (middle school) developed by https://aladdin.di.unimi.it/activities.html at my uni</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org62bdcf9">The activity consists of programming a "kangaroo" to get out of a maze by using programmatic steps.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org12fe414">The original activiuty was made in MAZE language but I used python, preferring an approach that more closely resembles real-life code</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgf19bc82">I also simplified the structure of the mazes, building discrete lattices instead of continuos mazes. This way, a turn can only be of 90 degrees</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#orgc3880dc">Keeping concepts simple by creating a discrete latex with easy way to rotate (no degrees involved) as that's not the goal and it would add useless friction. We want to concentrare only on the computational thinking aspect</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org0bead1b">The fact that every command relates to the kangaroo allows body-syntonic learning as theorized by papert for his programming language LOGO.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#orge8beaf9">J Wing position is that CT is composed of abstraction and automation</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org11c8846">She thinks that „CT is a method of solving a problem that focuses on its description, analysis and finding an effective solution, with an emphasis on systematicity and the use of concepts known in the field of computer science.</a></li>
<li><a href="#org94421e1">This workshop starts from the description and builds on basic commands to understand how to solve sistematically mazes. In the last stages, i.e. the highest goals in the learning outcomes, the students will be able to understand the abstraction and go over it by changing the mazes themselves2</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#orge4501b1">To the larners it should be made clear that the code they are running is the same as the one that powers the simulation. They should be given access to the original code, in order to copy parts and recognise useful bits</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org03d971d">gear-level understanding: the core is not the window of the game but the whole program including the code. the student is suggested to take a look at the code to understand what ahppens. It is not required a full understanding, but it is made possible for them to grasp the basics of the functioning of the program, while allowing them a easy interface to take part in the computation (using the same tools as the programmer of the activity, as the student writes real code).</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#orgf36ae51">Learners should be exposed to the whole code of the simulation and not just the code in the interface of the game. In that way, even not knowing programming, they can recognise patterns and gain insights that can help them</a></li>

<li><a href="#org2e736ba">Target,duration and learning outcomes</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org90f3453">This activity is towards ISCED 2 Lower Secondary School. Students should be aware of informatic competence such as algorithms, modeling and programming</a></li>
<li><a href="#org18d7e03">The time of one session of this activity is one hour. Several sessions should be `ade and i forecast that three sessions, 3 hours in total, would get student to reach the highest level of the learning outcome</a></li>
<li><a href="#org1e87f21">The workshop is separated in several layers, and the learning outcomes based on CSF (add something relating to it) that reflect the degree of understanding of the code and of CT concepts.</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org06927e3">This idea is based on Eshet Cognitive Skills Mastery Matrix from Are Computational Thinking Skills Measurable? An Analysis Loice Victorine Atienoa , Richard Kwabena Akrofi Baafib ,Turcsanyi-Szabo Marta</a></li>
<li><a href="#org34dff95">The first level is understanding the code and how it works: you can move and you can rotate and based on this you can slowly get to the end. It is possible to run the code several times, and it is possible to program every single step to be taken</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#orgd26898a">This takes half of the first session</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#org16166f3">A second level is to apply and analyze. By abstracting (WHO) and analyzing a student can apply the understanding they had before to new mazes (that can be generated by a teacher or use the prebuilt). When a student reaches the skill to solve the prebuilt mazes and some created ones, then he has reached this level</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org8c856ac">This is in the rest of the first session, and spans along the second session</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#orgfca2973">A third level is the level of creation and evaluation. A student understands alone if a solution is feasible, he does not need to run it to guess if it is gonig to work (except for some advanced ones), he understands solutions that take advantage of coding (using loops) (what can be "effectively" automated) fundamental question of computer science, sentence by Denning in 1989. The student is also able to interact with the code in an indipendent and creative manner</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org4ad474a">what do we mean by interact creatively? in a later stage, maybe second session of the workshop, students should be made aware that code they are running is the same that powers the maze. they are acting on the code itself. this means that they are able to change the code of the maze itself. They should be given access to the code that powers the simulations and they can look in the code for pattern recognition (an important concept in CT) and recognize names. They should be exposed to the different level of abstraction and shown that if you find a way, you can interact with the simulation itself (moving the kangaroo, changing the walls, changing the end square) examples will be given before the end of the workshop so that students will be free to experiment, challenging their assimilated knolwedge and incorportating some new knolwedge about computer systems</a></li>
<li><a href="#orge2718cb">this is reached after 3 hours, in the third session</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#org2d8abb1">Increasing Complexity: Gradually introduce maze complexity and programming constructs to maintain engagement and support differentiated learning, avoiding cognitive overload</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#org19ff6f8">The presence of a teacher who understands how the code works, even if they're not programmer themselves, is crucial</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org31edc71">In Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), the goal is that even students that start from the stage where they need assistance, they will eventually move to the stage of being able to carry out the activity alone</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#org2b1b8e3">The social aspect is crucial: As constructionism says, A child's cognitive development and learning ability can be guided and mediated by their social interactions. Learning is a crucially social process as opposed to an independent journey of discovery.</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org75c9888">This activity is wide: several solutions are possible and sharing them is reccomended and useful. One learner coming up with an idea and sharing it early would completely change the course of the activity</a></li>
<li><a href="#org93a00df">As the paper by TURCSANI says:</a></li>
<li><a href="#org0007a8c">Focus should be given that solution are not necessarily good or bad but they tackle the problem in different ways</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#org165f4dd">*Ways the workshop could be expanded</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#org5045e1f">Attributing a score based on the number of steps of the kangaroo and the number of lines of code (create a simple formula to show in the presentation), to let understand the student that elegant and efficient solutions that reuse code are the best</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgcd635aa">allowing multiplayer on the same maze, introducing ways for students to collaborate (invent examples that would allow students to have to cooperate for the good of both of them) (check link with papert constructionism and how knowledge is built by building but also by sharing)</a></li>
<li><a href="#org19be7da">Attribute a score based on the number of steps and lines of code (e.g., score = steps + 2 * lines<sub>of</sub><sub>code</sub>), teaching students the value of elegant, efficient solutions.</a></li>
<li><a href="#orgcd525e3">Collaborative Learning: Design multiplayer challenges where students must coordinate commands or share code segments, fostering social CT skills.</a></li>

We are talking about a person who gave an important contribute to computing in education.
</p>

<p>
Papert MIT made a project with Lego, he wants to teach children kids to be creative thinkers, in honour of Seymour Papert
<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/lego-foundation-endows-media-lab-fellowships-to-honor-the-legacy-of-seymour-papert/">https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/lego-foundation-endows-media-lab-fellowships-to-honor-the-legacy-of-seymour-papert/</a>
</p>

<p>
They made the lego mindstorm
</p>

<p>
There are two approaches relating to computing in education: Constructivism, proposed by Piaget and Constructionism, developed by Papert.
</p>

<p>
As described in (??, ????), Constructivism revolves around the idea of experience and active interaction as necessary tools for learning.
</p>

<p>
Papert, who worked with Piaget around 1960, built upon that idea and came up with a theory that shared the importance of learning through experience and added that this process happens through the creation and sharing of a public entity. (??, a)
</p>

<p>
An important part of the philosophy of Constructionism is the concept of <b>microworlds</b>, described as “…subset[s] of reality or a constructed reality so … as to allow a human learner to exercise particular powerful ideas or intellectual skills” (Papert 1980, p. 204).
</p>

<p>
Papert also believed that the right tool to implement microworlds is a computer, because "its essence is its universality, its power to simulate.". It can help to create an atmosphere that supports active involvement and promotes learning.
</p>

<p>
As a consequence, he developed Logo - a functional programming language based on Lisp - with the intent of introducing children to programming from a young age.
</p>

<p>
A key feature of the Logo programming language is <b>turtle graphics</b>, consisting of a cursor over a Cartesian plane. The cursor has a location, a direction and a pen. The direction of the cursor can be changed by the student with commands relative to its current position, by specifying an angle of rotation. This intuitive approach leads to what Papert called "body syntonic" reasoning (TODO explain what it is)
</p>

<p>
Over time, an active community developed around Logo and several implementations have been created. The <a href="https://constructionism2025.inf.ethz.ch/">Constructionism Conference</a> happens every 2 years and its the main one (TODO correct here)
</p>

<p>
Bebras is a competition for kids. (TODO what to do with this info)
</p>

<p>
Since Papert's definition of Constructionism, computing as a field has become even more important. Nowadays computers are important a key tool for design, engineering and science. Computer science has long become a discipline of its own, tightly coupled with Mathematics. Many countries are putting initiatives in place to spread the knowledge about the discipline.
</p>

<p>
Question for next time: what should kid be able to understand and know about computer science?

<h5 id="org34dff95">The first level is understanding the code and how it works: you can move and you can rotate and based on this you can slowly get to the end. It is possible to run the code several times, and it is possible to program every single step to be taken</h5>

They should be given access to the code that powers the simulations and they can look in the code for pattern recognition (an important concept in CT) and recognize names. They should be exposed to the different level of abstraction and shown that if you find a way, you can interact with the simulation itself (moving the kangaroo, changing the walls, changing the end square) examples will be given before the end of the workshop so that students will be free to experiment, challenging their assimilated knolwedge and incorportating some new knolwedge about computer systems</h6>

One of the non-technical skills enhanced by CT is connecting and expressing. De-
veloping projects using Scratch is further facilitated by sharing [7]. The learners de-
veloped collaboration skills by participating in group projects; presenting progress
of on going project in order to solicite more and unique ideas from their peers; and
peer-reviewing which helped in making a critical analysis of their projects. This
gave the learners confidence to express themselves fully

I really appreciated the course. It was very instructive and it gave me an idea about the history, the teaching and the situtation in several countries of computational thinking, even if i didn't have a strong background. The part about constructionism and constructivism and the one about misconceptions were the most interesting. Also sharing the curricula from our countries was an interesting part. The part about the curriculum in Czech Republic was interesting and very detailed, although I couldnt fully grasp every detail of it. It was a great and very instructive experience.
